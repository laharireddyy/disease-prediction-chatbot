# 🧠 Disease Predictor and AI Health Chatbot

This project combines a machine learning model for disease prediction with a Gemini-powered AI chatbot for general health advice. It features an interactive Streamlit-based frontend and is containerized using Docker for consistent development environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Disease Predictor**: Predicts likely diseases based on selected symptoms using a trained Decision Tree model.
- 💬 **AI Chatbot**: Ask questions about diseases, symptoms, and prevention powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash.
- 🖼️ **Visual Support**: Displays relevant disease images and descriptions.
- 📦 **Streamlit UI**: Clean and interactive interface for both prediction and conversation.
- 🐳 **Dev Container Ready**: Includes `.devcontainer` setup for VS Code + Docker environments.

## Run the project

- The project is already intialised with the Docker-based dev setup files.

- Clone the project using : git clone https://github.com/abhisathvik/disease-prediction-chatbot

🐳 Dev Container Setup


If you’re using VS Code with Docker:
- 	Open project in VS Code.
- 	Press F1 → Dev Containers: Reopen in Container.
- 	The container will build and install dependencies automatically.
